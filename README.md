## 💼 About Me

I’m a full-scholarship student with a strong academic foundation and hands-on experience in:

- 🧠 Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- 🔢 Optimization and Time-Series Forecasting
- 🧰 Backend & Systems Engineering
- 🌐 Full-Stack Python Development

My work often revolves around transforming abstract ideas into deployable, high-impact solutions. From deep learning pipelines to intelligent transport systems, I aim to solve real-world problems with data and code.
